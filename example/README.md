Examples
========

This folder contains the following examples:

TENSOAP-FAST-tutorial
---------------------

This is the recommended starting point for a first-time user, covering how to build a model using the TENSOAP code, how to convert it to a model that can be used in TENSOAP-FAST, and how to implement this model to make predictions.

SAGPR-example-standard
----------------------

This example shows how to use a pre-built model to make predictions about the properties of a system.

SAGPR-example-sockets
---------------------

This example shows the interface between TENSOAP-FAST and i-PI, for making predictions while carrying out a molecular dynamics calculation.

SAGPR-example-committee
-----------------------

This example uses committee models to predict not only the response properties of a system but the uncertainty in these properties.

TENSOAP-FAST-LODE-tutorial
--------------------------

As TENSOAP-FAST-tutorial, but using models built with long-range descriptors.

LODE-example-standard
---------------------

As SAGPR-example-standard, but using models built with long-range descriptors.

LODE-example-sockets
--------------------

As SAGPR-example-sockets, but using models built with long-range descriptors.

LODE-example-committee
----------------------

As SAGPR-example-committee, but using models built with long-range descriptors.

models

This folder contains models published in the literature.
